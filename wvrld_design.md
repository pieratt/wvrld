- page bg = color 2 (the pages do not currently seem to be pulling a dynamic bg color at all)
- page font = color 1
- post card bg = color 1
- post card font = color 2
- on the front page, each post should be the colors of the user who first created that post
- on the front page, each url row should be the color of the user who added that URL. They are not always the same thing since Posts are combined from multiple users. 
- on the user page, since all the content is theirs, all the colors should be either their color1 or color2. 

filter nav:
- one TLD per row
- each row inside a pill
- the pill style follows the same rules as the post cards, so 
- pill bg = color 2
- pill font = color 1

Other:
- The title of each post should be centered inside its card
- the user who created the post should be listed beneath the post title, also centered, at 70% opacity
- The url row Favicon should be twice as large and sitting to the left of both rows of text 
- in the URL meta description row, each item should be clickable. The TLD should take you to the URL. The username should take you to the /username and the Saved should save it (this one works). Each one should underline on hover.
- Save/Saved should stay underlined if it is in the Saved status.
